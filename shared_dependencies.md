Shared Dependencies:

1. **Exported Variables:**
   - `shapeParameters`: This variable is exported from `shapeParameters.js` in both the front-end and back-end. It represents the parameters of the geometric shape generated by the OpenAI API.

2. **Data Schemas:**
   - `shapeData`: This schema is used in the back-end to structure the data received from the OpenAI API. It includes properties like shape type, dimensions, and other parameters.

3. **DOM Element IDs:**
   - `textInput`: The ID of the text input field in the front-end where users enter their geometric shape descriptions.
   - `generateButton`: The ID of the "Generate" button that triggers the shape generation process.
   - `modelDisplay`: The ID of the area where the generated 3D model is displayed.

4. **Message Names:**
   - `generateShape`: This is the name of the message sent from the front-end to the back-end when the user clicks the "Generate" button. It includes the user's text input as data.
   - `shapeGenerated`: This is the name of the message sent from the back-end to the front-end when the shape parameters have been generated. It includes the shape parameters as data.

5. **Function Names:**
   - `handleGenerate`: This function is triggered when the "Generate" button is clicked. It sends the `generateShape` message to the back-end.
   - `handleShapeGenerated`: This function is triggered when the `shapeGenerated` message is received from the back-end. It updates the `shapeParameters` variable and triggers the 3D model rendering.
   - `analyzeText`: This function is used in the back-end to analyze the user's text input using the OpenAI API and generate the shape parameters.
   - `renderShape`: This function is used in the front-end to render the 3D model based on the `shapeParameters`.

6. **Shared Libraries and APIs:**
   - `React.js`: Used in the front-end for building the user interface.
   - `Node.js`: Used in the back-end for handling requests and processing data.
   - `OpenAI API`: Used in the back-end for analyzing text and generating shape parameters.
   - `Three.js` or `Babylon.js`: Used in the front-end for rendering the 3D model.
   - `REST API`: Used for communication between the front-end and back-end.
